\section{Haystack}
  Three parts combined makes they Haystack system, it is the 
  Haystack Directory, Haystack Store and the Haystack Cache.
  Each one of them serving its own pupose. The Directory allowing for
  simplifications when finding the image on the actual servers containing the
  image. That server part is the Haystack Store, it contains the actual data, and
  allows for reading, writing and deleting. The cache is a cusomized cache so that
  it is very fast to find files that is newly uploaded.

\subsection{Haystack Directory}
  What the Haystack Directory provides is mappings between physical and logical
  volumes, this mapping is then used when constructing a url for image request.
  The Directory can also determines if the request handled by CDN or by the 
  Haystack Cache directly. 
  \inlinetodo{the directory also handles loadbalancing and discs that are full}
\subsection{Haystack Store}
  The Haystack Store maintains persistant storage for images. On request it returns
  either the photo, or an error if file not found. \\
  An datastructure of maps between keys and images are kept in-memory to retrieve
  the images as fast as possible. The datastructure includes data such as offset,
  size ,flags, a cookie with a random number,  aswell as the corresponding key.  
  Haystack Store allowes for three operations: read, write and delete.\\
  To read a picture from the Store the key is read, file is thereby found by the mappings
  and the cookies random number is checked aswell as the integrity of the file, and then
  returned. To write a picture to the Haystack Store, the Haystack webservers will provide
  necessary values for the mappings and then append it to the disk.
  Delete is simple, just set flag to notify that the file is deleted, and the delete
  is handled later.
  
\subsection{Haystack Cache}
  The cache is organized as a distributed hash table, and the photo id is used as key.
  If it is found in cache it will respond to either CDN or user, depending on who made
  the request. A request from CDN will not be cached, and neither will a request from a
  full Store machine. The reason for this is that if they would cache CDN the reason for
  the Haystack Cache will be lost, hence that was one of the reasons for using something
  else. Also, if a request is coming from a full Store machine, because it has been proven
  that the most heavily accessed photos is they who were just uploaded, hence from a write 
  enabled Store.
