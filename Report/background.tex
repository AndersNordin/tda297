\section{Background}
Photo files are characterized by how the users tend to access them, they belong to the group of data that is typically writtens once, read often, never modified and rarely deleted.
 

The authors of the paper find that a classic POSIX based filesystem use to much space for metadata, things like file permission is not used at all. Also the metadeta has to be read from disk into memory to find the actual file.
