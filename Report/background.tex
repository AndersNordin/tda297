\section{Background}
Photo files are characterized by how the users tend to access them, they belong
to the group of data that is typically writtens once, read often, never modified
and rarely deleted.

The previous system used a combination of Network File System, NFS and Content
Delivery Networks, CDN. The CDN provided a cache of 
the most common pictures and the NFS filesystem provided them with a proven and
a easy to maintain file system. When the system started to grow they saw problems
with scalability, one of them being that the most popular pictures might not even be
interesting for most of the users. They found that it was more dependent of the time
the file had existed rather than how many that has seen the file. As you may know the
photos uploaded most recently is the photo that is most popular. Another problem with
the system was that in order to fetch data a lot of unnecessary information was stored
and in order to find a single image a lot of I/O operations was needed.\\
