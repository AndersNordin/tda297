\section{Introduction}
Facebook is a relatively new company and has grown really much the last couple of years and is today a part of most peoples everyday life. The large number of users that share and upload files every hour consumes tons of data that must be stored and available for the users to interact with. 

This report is based on the paper "Finding a needle in Haystack: Facebook's photo storage" which deals with the problem of all photos on Facebook. To cite the authors in the paper: "Facebook currently stores over 260 billion images, which translates to over 20 petabytes of data. Users upload one billion new photos(~ 60 terabyte) each week and Facebook serves over one million images per  second at peak." 

The writers of this reports reads the Advanced course of Distributed Systems at Chalmers University in Gothenburg. With our current knowledge in the area we will review the paper and explain the solution together with our criticism.
