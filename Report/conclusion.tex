\section{Conclusion}
We find that the paper is a good study of a real world problem where they have tailored
a system to fit their needs and adapted it to the users behaviour. The strongest property
of the system is the utilization of disc space and thereby scalability. 

Although, it is missing a lot of important details to be able to replicate and get a
thorough understanding of how the system works. The topic of consistency for instance
is completely left out.

It would be interesting to know if they are using the Haystack system for something else in
the facebook environment. For example user posts, which can be argued have roughly the
same properties as the pictures, although posts does not take up the same amount of
space.
