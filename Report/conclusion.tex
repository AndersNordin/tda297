\section{Conclusion}
We find that the paper is a good study of a real world problem where they have tailored 
a system to fit their needs. The strongest propertiy of the sytem is the utilization of
disc space and thereby scaleability. 

Although, it is missing alot of important details to be able to replicate and get a
thourogh understanding of how the system works. The topic of consistency for instance
is completely left out.

It would be interesting to know if they are using the Haystack system for something else in
the facebook environment. For example user posts, which can be argued have roughly the 
same properties as the pictures, although posts does not take up the same amount of 
space.
