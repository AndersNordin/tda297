\subsection{Fault-tolerance}
They talk about fault-tolerance, but not much about how to solve faulty messages, mostly
about faulty drives. It is assumed that everything is working, and a system named pitchfork
is proactivly checking for failures. An other aproach could be to build a system where this
is not needed. It is a way to make sure that messages are not sent to faulty entities.
